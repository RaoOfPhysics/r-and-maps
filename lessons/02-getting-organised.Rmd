# Structuring your project

Objectives:

* To be able to create self-contained projects in RStudio
* To be able to transfer things from the console to a file
* To be able to create a R markdown document

## Interactive work vs scripts

Move from interactive work to a script. Why? How?


## Reports

Humans understand the world through narratives, or stories. Figures, tables
and code by themselves do not tell a story. They are more like a collection of
factoids. However a story without figures, tables and code is just a rumour or
folklore. The combination of facts and narrative is what allows people to
understand and be convinced.

One way to combine your narrative with figures and tables is
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). You can use a single
Rmarkdown file to both:

* save and execute code; and
* generate high quality reports that can be shared with your audience

In fact most of this tutorial is written using Rmarkdown!

> ## R notebooks
>
> At the start of October RStudio gained a ["R notebook"
> interface](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-notebooks/). If you like Rmarkdown
> check it out in the preview release of RStudio.

> ## Output options
>
> Chunk output can be customized with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/)
> options, arguments set in the `{}` of a chunk header. Five useful arguments:
>
> * include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the
>   finished file. Rmarkdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the
>   results can be used by other chunks.
> * echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in
>   the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
> * message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from
>   appearing in the finished file.
> * warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from
>   appearing in the finished.
> * fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.

> Check the [R Markdown Reference
> Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for more knitr
> options.
