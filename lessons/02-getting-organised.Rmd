## Interactive work vs scripts

Move from interactive work to a script. Why? How?


## Reports

Humans understand the world through narratives, or stories. Figures, tables
and code by themselves do not tell a story. They are more like a collection of
factoids. However a story without figures, tables and code is just a rumour or
folklore. The combination of facts and narrative is what allows people to
understand and be convinced.

One way to combine your narrative with figures and tables is
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). You can use a single
Rmarkdown file to both:

* save and execute code; and
* generate high quality reports that can be shared with your audience

In fact most of this tutorial is written using Rmarkdown!
