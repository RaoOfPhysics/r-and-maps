# Putting you data on the map

Plots are nice, but interactive plots are nicer!

Objectives:

* To understand the use of interactive elements
* To be able to place simple markers on a leaflet map
* To be able to create popups with contents that depends on the data


## DataTables

Interactive tables are a good way to quickly explore your data, especially for
others who are reading your report.

```{r}
library(DT)
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
datatable(gapminder)
```


## Leaflet

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a javascript library that is commonly
used to create interactive webmaps. There is an R library that allows you to
use `leaflet` without having to know any javascript.
